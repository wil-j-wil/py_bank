### An auditory filter bank implementation in Python ###

Contains implementations of an Equal Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) filter bank and a linear filter bank.

Based on Josh McDermott’s original Matlab implementation in the [Sound Texture Synthesis Toolbox](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/Sound_Texture_Synthesis_Toolbox_v1.7.zip)

Filter banks are a very useful time-frequency analysis tool. A nice alternative to your standard spectrograms.

See ‘example.py’ for a demo.
